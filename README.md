# A website game that sets you through a tournament with League of Legends Characters, playing as Twisted Fate. Fighting your way to the top to take your place in the League of Legends.
# Peer review: Elizabeth Trotter - The code works well, and the storyline made the game very fun to play. I have a small suggestion to add all styling (the background image) to your css file rather than html, but other than that great job! I especially love the overall aesthetic of this game, very cool!
